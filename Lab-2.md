# Lab 2 - Basic Circuits

# By: Noah Lane & Lily Schlaug
# Summary
Lab goal; summary of work performed; summary of outcome
Lab 1 will be somewhat different since this is an introduction to the equipment.
# Materials

Solder breadboard

Solderless breadboard

Solder

Wires

1kΩ, 2x 2.2 kΩ, 4.7 kΩ, 5.1 kΩ, 6.8 kΩ, 15 kΩ, 220 kΩ Resistors

# Assembly Procedures
Provide basic summary of steps performed in lab (Do not copy and paste from lab assignment.) The important part here is to provide detail that you had to develop in the lab which will be more important in later labs.
You must include Schematics, Engineering Drawings, and Programming if appropriate in this section.

Part 1-Series circuit
1. Place the 1kΩ, 2.2 kΩ and 5.1 kΩ in series on the solder breadboard
2. Solder the resistors into place on the back of the solder breadboard
3. Remove excess material

Part 2.1-Parallel circuit
1. Using the 2.2 kΩ, 4.7 kΩ, 6.8 kΩ, 15 kΩ, and 220 kΩ resistors construct the parallel circuit with the 4.7 kΩ, 6.8 kΩ, and 15 kΩ resistors in series and the 2.2 kΩ and 220 kΩ resistors in parallel 
2. Place the power wire in the same row as the 4.7 kΩ resistor and the ground wire in the same row as the 
3. For step 5, remove the 5.5 kΩ resistor

Part 2.2-Parallel circuit
1. Start with the circuit from Part 2.1
2. Remove the 5.5 kΩ resistor from the circuit
